## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need to have `node`,`npm` or `yarn`, `TypeScript` already installed locally

### Setup

`Clone the project and cd into the directory`

### Install

run `npm install` or `yarn` to install all the dependencies of the project.

### Add env file

create a `.env` file in the project root directory and add the following env vars:

- API_BASE_URL : This is a url which `json-server` will run on example: `http://localhost:4000`

### Usage

run `npm dev` or `yarn dev` to get the project running

open browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`

&nbsp;

### Customizations

The styles are written using css modules and extend default Mantine Ui styles.

To tweak Next.js(React) components navigate to following directories

- `/components`
- `/containers`
- `/features`
- `/routes`

To access application theming navigate to `theme.ts`

To access global styles navigate to `/src/styles/index.css`

See [Mantine UI](https://mantine.dev/) documentation for how to theme and tweak relevant styles

## Tests

Mostly Integration are written.

To access tests they can be found in components that require testing.

### Running Tests

run `npm test` or `yarn test` to get the tests running

- `typecheck` – checks TypeScript types
- `lint` – runs ESLint
- `prettier:check` – checks files with Prettier
- `jest` – runs jest tests
- `jest:watch` – starts jest watch
- `test` – runs `jest`, `prettier:check`, `lint` and `typecheck` scripts

### Other scripts

- `prettier:write` – formats all files with Prettier

#### Analysis report
